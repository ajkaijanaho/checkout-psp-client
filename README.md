# Checkout Finland Payment Service Client API Wrapper

This package implements a wrapper for the [Checkout Finland Payment
Service Client API](https://checkoutfinland.github.io/psp-api/#/) that
ecommerce software developers can use to integrate their ecommerce
checkout systems with the Checkout Finland payment service.

I wrote this for my company's webshop and I am releasing it in case
others find it useful.  My priority is my own shop, but I will accept
bug reports and merge requests that improve on the core functionality.
For functionality to be included that my shop does not need, someone
else (who is personally invested in it) must commit to its
maintenance.

This package is not written or sponsored by Checkout Finland, and
there is no other relationship between them and myself than that, at
the time of this writing, I run one of their merchant clients.
